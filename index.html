            <p>As a leader, have you found yourself comparing your mission and vision to what is happening in your
                organization? When you look honestly, do you see a gap between what you say your organization is about
                and
                what is actually taking place? When faced with a difficult decision or hiring choice, do you ever
                consider
                the mission and vision of the organization? Or do you just find the person that fits the job description
                instead of finding the person who best fits the mission and vision?</p>
