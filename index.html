            <p>As a leader, have you found yourself comparing your mission and vision to what is happening in your
                organization? When you look honestly, do you see a gap between what you say your organization is about
                and
                what is actually taking place? When faced with a difficult decision or hiring choice, do you ever
                consider
                the mission and vision of the organization? Or do you just find the person that fits the job description
                instead of finding the person who best fits the mission and vision?</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>In many organizations, there is a huge gap or a great divide between who we say we are and how we do
                business, between the overarching mission of the office and the activities the office promotes. How many
                of your teams or committees look at the mission and vision when planning activities?</p>
