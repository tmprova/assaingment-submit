            <p>As a leader, have you found yourself comparing your mission and vision to what is happening in your
                organization? When you look honestly, do you see a gap between what you say your organization is about
                and
                what is actually taking place? When faced with a difficult decision or hiring choice, do you ever
                consider
                the mission and vision of the organization? Or do you just find the person that fits the job description
                instead of finding the person who best fits the mission and vision?</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>In many organizations, there is a huge gap or a great divide between who we say we are and how we do
                    business, between the overarching mission of the office and the activities the office promotes. How
                    many
                    of your teams or committees look at the mission and vision when planning activities?</p>

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>Office's need a honing process so that core ideas, core initiatives, and core activities embrace the
                    mission. Utilizing a mission filter question or statement can consistently focus everyone’s
                    attention
                    and energy on where they are going and why.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>What if your office had a filter for planning and decision-making? What if your leaders had a
                    question to
                    ask their teams to keep the brainstorming process focused on the “why”? What if, when tensions rise
                    and
                    ideas compete, leaders could utilize a mission filter to redirect the attention of the group?</p>

            <h2>Develop Without Limits</h2>
            <p>A mission statement is not enough. Office's need a honing process so that core ideas, core initiatives,
                and core activities embrace the mission. Utilizing a mission filter question or statement can
                consistently focus everyone’s attention and energy on where they are going and why. For a office or
                organization, a mission filter is a self-monitoring tool that gives leaders the ability to test their
                systems for engaging and serving people beyond their walls. It connects and brings clarity between
                mission, vision, and action steps.</p>
