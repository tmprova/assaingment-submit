        <p>As a leader, have you found yourself comparing your mission and vision to what is happening in your
            organization? When you look honestly, do you see a gap between what you say your organization is about and
            what is actually taking place? When faced with a difficult decision or hiring choice, do you ever consider
            the mission and vision of the organization? Or do you just find the person that fits the job description
            instead of finding the person who best fits the mission and vision?</p>
